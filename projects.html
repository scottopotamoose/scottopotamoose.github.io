        <h3>Project 1</h3>
            <p>I was borrowing my wife's pomodoro clock after she finished undergrad, but she's going to need it back. This is not a traditional pomodoro as much as it is a timer with mulitle preset time buttons. See project <a href="projects/pomodoro/pomodoro.html">here</a></p>
        <h3>Project 2</h3>
            <p>Some kind of calculator for running dropset workouts would be helpful.</p>
        <h3>Project 3</h3>
            <p>???</p>
        <h3>Project 4</h3>
          <p>Simple chore management app.</p>
