        <p>Aside from the larger projects below that I want to create, I'll be completing the 40 projects (my own interpretation of them) in the freeCodeCamp JS projects section over at <a href="https://codepen.io/scottopotamoose" target="_blank">CodePen.</a> I'm also trying out exercism.</p>
        <h3>Project 1 - Complete</h3>
            <p>I was borrowing my wife's pomodoro clock after she finished undergrad, but she's going to need it back soon. <br> 
            This is not a traditional pomodoro as much as it is an alarm clock with multiple preset timer buttons. <br>
            Formatting for multiple viewports was not a consideration at this time as I made it for my own setup, but after using for a bit I'd like to turn it into a desktop app as well.<br> 
            See project <a href="projects/pomodoro/pomodoro.html" target="_blank">here</a></p>
        <h3>Project 2</h3>
            <p>Some kind of calculator for running dropset workouts would be helpful.</p>
        <h3>Project 3</h3>
            <p>This site isn't by any means sleek or current industry best practices as I'm prioritizing studies and other projects, but I will be coming back through and add JS functionality and make the site more responsive and viewer-friendly, mostly as a chance to implement these concepts of design.</p>
        <h3>Project 4</h3>
          <p>Simple chore management app.</p>
