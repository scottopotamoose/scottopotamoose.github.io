        <p>Aside from the larger projects below that I want to create, I'll be completing the 40 projects (my own interpretation of them) in the freeCodeCamp JS projects section over at <a href="https://codepen.io/scottopotamoose" target="_blank">CodePen.</a> I also just started <a href="https://exercism.org/profiles/scottopotamoose" target="_blank">Exercism</a>.</p>
        <h3>Project 1</h3>
            <p>I was borrowing my wife's pomodoro clock after she finished undergrad, but she's going to need it back soon.<br> 
            This is not a traditional pomodoro as much as it is an alarm clock with multiple preset timer buttons.<br>
            Formatting for multiple viewports was not a consideration at this time as I made it for my own setup, but after using for a bit I'd like to turn it into a desktop app as well.<br> 
            See project <a href="projects/pomodoro/pomodoro.html" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
        <h3>Project 2</h3>
            <p>A calculator for running dropset workouts would be helpful.</p>
        <h3>Project 3</h3>
            <p>???</p>
        <h3>Project 4</h3>
          <p>Chore management app.</p>
