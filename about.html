        <p class="aboutme">
            In college, I played around with web and game development and enjoyed both immensely.<br>Unfortunately I had little time to practice these hobbies except during school breaks.<br>Despite these time restraints, I was able to do all the homework for a friend's CompSci development course.<br> I also created several websites and all of the Unity tutorial games.<br>I had a portfolio site around this time with completed projects, but I let the hosting lapse when I graduated and instead built a Wix portfolio for my technical writing works.
            <br><br>
                        
            I then attempted to create my own Contra-esque side-scrolling game.<br>After investing many hours, I was blocked by not having enough time to learn all of the art tools required.<br>
            I don't consider myself an artist by any means, but I did enjoy creating several graphs and icons for school projects, including an entire branding exercise.<br>I have also been known to redownload GIMP and Photoshop occasionally to make silly things (see picture above).
            <br><br>
            
            When I started in cybersecurity, I had just studied for and received the Comptia A+ certification.<br>Within a year I was a shift lead, and not long after that, I was promoted to associate-level.<br>I put in the study hours and paid attention to what was going on around me.<br>After several years of climbing the ladder in cybersecurity, I've realized that I need a more creative and hands-on element in my career. 
            <br><br>
            
            Even with a full plate, I've loved spending time exploring web development again.<br>So far, I've completed two video courses on Udemy for HTML/CSS/Javascript, built a few test sites, and am most of the way through the second freecodecamp course.<br> 
            I am excited to be a developer and to learn more and more as the projects become increasingly complex and demanding.<br>I'm also interested in UX/UI design concepts and making the web even more accessible for people with impairments and disabilities.
